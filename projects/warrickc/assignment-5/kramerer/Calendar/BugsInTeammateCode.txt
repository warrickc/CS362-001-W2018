Bug 1:
After running my random tests, I got a weird error in one of the random tests.
I initially had no idea why a divide by 0 error would have come up in the CalendarUtil class. 
I know that I didn’t change anything in my code for introducing bugs, so I figured it may have been an introduced bug. 
So, I then decided to take a look at the code itself. After going line by line, I'm trying to see if there could possibly be a divide by 0 anywhere.
On line 50 in CalendarUtil.java, there is a declaration of int x = 5/0, which would cause the error if the year was ever set to 2400. 
I don’t believe I would have ever caught this bug if it wasn’t for random testing. 
Since random testing runs over 30000 times, it was a pretty good shot to hit year 2400, but still semi-lucky.

Method: IsLeapYear(Int year)

Bug 2:
This next bug I found when I was looking at the code coverage of my random test cases on my partner’s faulty code. 
I knew what my code’s coverage looked like so I had some sort of a base line. 
I looked at the Jacoco code coverage report and after going through most of the code, I noticed in TimeTable had some generally crappy coverage 
and that getApptOccurences had some really crappy coverage. 
I knew that getApptOccurences had upwards of 90%+ coverage from my test cases in the random tests, so what was going on here? 
Because of the deviation from the baseline, I decided to look at the code a little bit more.
I then saw that iterator never has a next from the object created on line 56, apptOccursOnDays. 
Additionally, apptOccursOnDays is built incorrectly. It calls firstDay, firstDay instead of firstDay, lastDay. 
What this will do will create a list of only 1 object every time, instead of enumerating all of the appointments during the set date spread, 
thus leading to not being able to use has.Next() on the iterator.

Method: getApptOccurences.
